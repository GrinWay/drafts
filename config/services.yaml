    imports:

###> imports are loaded first (imports not overrides existing services) ###
imports:
    -   resource: 'services_yaml/resource_services.yaml'    # (last)
    -   resource: 'services_yaml/services/'                 # 
    -   resource: 'services_yaml/parameters/'               #
    -   resource: 'services_yaml/custom/'                   # (first)

###> then services.yaml (what below overrides imports) ###
###>... it's better to use only imports
